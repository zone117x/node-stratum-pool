  "readme": "base58\n======\n\nAn implementation of Base58 and Base58Check encodings for nodejs.  Note, the\nimplementation of Base58Check differs slightly from that described on Wikipedia\nin that it does not prepend a version byte onto the data being encoded.  This\nimplementation uses the bignum library (which is a native module and uses the\nopenssl bignumber library functions).\n\nNOTE: earlier versions of this package used native C code instead of bignum, but\nit was found to be unstable in a production environment (likely due to bugs in the\nC code).  This version uses bignum and appears to be very stable, but slower.  The\nC version of this package is still available on the \"native-module\" branch.  A few\nadditional methods added to bignum would probably bring the speed of this version \non part with with C version.  \n\nInstallation\n============\n\n    npm install base58-native\n\nUsage\n=====\n\n    var base58 = require('base58-native');\n    base58.encode(base58.decode('mqqa8xSMVDyf9QxihGnPtap6Mh6qemUkcu'));\n\n    var base58Check = require('base58-native').base58Check;\n    base58Check.encode(base58Check.decode('mqqa8xSMVDyf9QxihGnPtap6Mh6qemUkcu'));\n",
